            <p>I am Alexander, I am 28 years old. I live in Baranovichi. I work for the military.</p>
            <p>In 2009, he entered the Baranovichi State College of Light Industry, majoring in information technology.</p>
            <p>In 2014, he graduated from college and entered Baranovichi State University, the same specialty.</p>
            <p>In 2014, he joined the army. At the end of my service in the country there was a difficult economic situation, besides, I did not have any knowledge in programming and I decided to stay on the contract.</p>
            <p>In 2019, he graduated from BarSU, but being afraid to leave the comfort zone, he continued to serve in the army.</p>
            <p>Looking back, I can remember the moments of my life that I would like to change and do not want to regret after some time that I have not changed my place of work at the moment</p>

            <p>Currently, it is impossible to imagine your life without the Internet. We use it all the time: at home, on the way to and from work, at work. And what are we looking at on the Internet? to websites. All self-respecting companies have them and their number is only increasing. And companies that already have websites will improve, redo and supplement them over time.</p>
            <p>In the army, there is no room for creativity and a sense of admiration for the work done, which gives web development.</p>
